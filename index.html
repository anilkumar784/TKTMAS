<div style="background-size:cover;background-color:brown;"><center><font style="font-size:20px;"><center><font style="font-size:30px;"><center><br>Under Australian labour laws, workers for food delivery apps are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. This means they are not entitled to minimum wage, sick leave, annual leave and other entitlements.

In NSW, some workers are entitled to compensation for their families if they die in the workplace or as a result of a work-related injury. Employees are largely covered by these laws but for independent contractors it can vary.

The families of Chen and Chow told Guardian Australia previously that they still did not know how much compensation they would receive for their relatives’ deaths.

On Friday, before the two most recent deaths in Sydney, a spokesman for Porter told Guardian Australia that companies should look at doing more to provide protections for their workers.

“It would seem that there are potential commercial advantages for companies that go the extra step to look after their workforce, whether they are employees or contractors,” he said. “As with any other employer, those with the best reputation and policies that benefit workers will be more sought after as the workplace of choice.”

After Monday’s collision, the driver of the truck was taken to St Vincent’s hospital for mandatory testing. Police investigations are ongoing.

Mr. Alt will be tasked with managing expenses as consumer demand continues to fluctuate during the pandemic. He will also oversee how Sysco controls inventory of food, payroll and cash flow during the winter, when the company expects pandemic-related restrictions to tighten. In the longer term, the new finance chief will lead efforts to cut costs, win customers and make investments, Mr. Hourican said.
